# Typescript Challenges
The [Boston Code and Coffee meetup](https://www.meetup.com/boston-code-and-coffee/) hosts the 
Coding Challenge Workshop.

The “coding interview” is used as a gateway interview at many companies. 
You must do well on the challenge to get in.

Whether it's a live session, where you are handed a marker and pointed to the whiteboard or 
the remote link to a HackeRank shared coding environment, this is a tough challenge for everyone.

Preparation will improve how you perform and demonstrate your skills.

The Coding Challenge Workshop is a one-hour session. In the workshop, we will cover the following:
   discuss the process of ramping up coding skills in a tech stack
   doing well in the live coding challenge
   practice solving challenges as in a group and on your own. 

Bring your laptop, and you may work along on the problem at your own screen.
