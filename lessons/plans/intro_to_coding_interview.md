# How to Succeed at the Technical Interview

## Preparing for the Interview
- Take courses ahead of time - algorithms, data structures, language internals. 
- Avoid one "big day" cram session; prefer a regular and continuous,  just one or two problems, every single day. 
- Practice, practice, practice....
- When you complete a problem, compare your solution to existing solutions on the site. Learn new ideas and techniques. Try to reuse these on similar problems.
- Get used to the interview development environment. Ask the recruiter about the test environment ahead of time, the practice of doing problems in that interview IDE

## Learn the Company
- Learn about the company - products, competitors? 
- Use Glassdoor and other research sites. 
- What other roles are open? How do they line up with the roles you are interested in? 
- Look up the interviewer on Linked In, etc.; people usually ask questions related to their experience.  
- Language and Tech Stack Familiarity Vs. Problem-Solving Skills: 
	- Get idea of what the company wants. Best way is to ask.
	- Some company need a deep expert on a specific stack who will be productive immediately
	- other companies what a strong generalist who can learn their stack and help improve it. 
# So tell Me About Yourself...
- Prepare a one minute personal bio or introduction.
- Hit the highlights
- Speak to the audience, which of your projects matter?
- Emphasize accomplishments and value delivered.  

### Prepare questions for the Interviewer.
Write up questions for the interviewer. More specific is better. Strive to show your interest in the company with good questions.
Example stock questions - if you run out of specifics.
 - What is your favorite thing about this company? 
 - What is something you learned working here?
 - Do you have scaling issues with the distributed services?

## Clock management
- Learn clock management. Practice with a stopwatch.
- Practice the checklist using the clock 

###  Example 15 Minutes Check List
- practice with stopwatch until your timing is consistent
- read the prompt --  1 min
- ask clarifying questions -- 2 min
- list test cases - 1 min
- high level approach -  1 min
- implement - 7 min
- test - 1 min
- debug - 2 min

## Interview Mechanics
Take action on issues you control. 
- Dress a little better than the interviewer. Ties are not needed. Default - khaki pants and a collared shirt, or equivalent. ( "old money" financial companies dress up in suits, and some law firms)
- Show up 5 to 10 minutes early  (more if you might have to deal with traffic)

### In Person Interview
- Get the directions loaded into the phone ahead of time
- Bring a snack or water
- Have your phone charged

### Remote Interview
- Ensure quiet, no interruptions
- Get good lighting for the web camera - LED ring light is like $15
- If you do not have an isolated room, get a headset with a quality microphone

## At the Interview
- Read the problem carefully
- Write unit tests. 
- Think about edge cases
- Keep notes as you go
- Don't get stuck; keep trying
- Talk out loud as you go
- Don't worry too much about formatting 

### Interview Soft Skills 
- demonstrate you interpersonal skills 

#### Agreement and disagreement
- show participants great potential team members,  beyond simple technical proficiency
- listen attentively, respond thoughtfully
- engaging with the interviewer: be balanced
	- accept feedback: is your solution incomplete or taking a bad approach
	- disagree on principle: sometime the correct answer will be to politely disagree, present that alternative, and get feedback

#### Strategies for Asking Questions:
- Ask clarifying questions
- good question impact the interview outcome and demonstrate a candidateâ€™s thoughtful approach.
- discussing the preferred programming language. 
	- should your solution use of prebuilt methods 
	- or do you need to implement from scratch
- primitive type edge cases 
- data structures edge cases 
- failures in network
- failures in memory
- failures in storage

# Optimal Solution Vs. Completed Solution
- clock management
- most interviewers come with multiple questions
- stand out candidates nearly always answer most or all the questions
- consider if its better to give three ok solution vs one perfect solution - ask the interviewer..
- consider the trade off between clear maintainable code vs complex but highly optimized code.
