# String problem #2 - phrase substitution

principle: tables and structures

Replace phrases with these SMS short hands, when the phrase ends with the input

- inputs are a single string
- inputs are ASCII character words separated by one or more space characters
- inputs are all lowercase

|Phrase|Replacement|
|--|--|
| as far as i know | AFAIK |
| as soon as possible | ASAP |
| away from keyboard | AFK |
| best friend forever | BFF |
| in real life |IRL |
| just kidding | JK |
| laugh out loud | LOL |

*“send the package as soon as  possible”* **=>** *“send the package ASAP”*
